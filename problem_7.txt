This algorithm uses the trie data structure to implement an HTTPRouter like
you would find in a typical web server.

Time complexity
linear O(n)
n is the length of path_list because it has one
for-loop that iterates from 1 to n which results in a running time grows 
directly in proportion to n. 

Space complexity
linear O(n)
 n is the length of path_list because the size of the underlying array scales proportionally
to the length of the path_list.
